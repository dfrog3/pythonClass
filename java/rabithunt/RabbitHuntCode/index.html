<p>This program was developed in <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a>, which 
  is a nice IDE for beginners, but the program does not depend on BlueJ in any 
  way. If you don't use BlueJ, just take the <code>.java</code> files (and optionally 
  the <code>.class</code> files) and ignore the rest (<code>.project</code>, <code>.classpath</code>, 
  <code>.pkg</code>, <code>.pkh</code>, <code>.ctxt</code>). BlueJ produces a 
  (simplified) UML diagram which shows the structure of the program, as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="RabbitHuntUML.jpg" width="711" height="614"></p>
<p>Each orange box represents a class. There are two classes containing a <code>main</code> 
  method, <code>RabbitHunt</code> and <code>Grader</code>. <code>RabbitHunt</code> 
  runs the program in a GUI; <code>Grader</code> automatically runs the program 
  a few hundred times, very quickly, and tells what percentage of the time the 
  rabbit escaped.</p>
<p>The <code>Grader</code> class, as its name implies, was used for grading purposes. 
  I did not provide the <code>Grader</code> class to the students, but rather 
  encouraged them to write their own version. That was a mistake; none did, and 
  many students had no clue how well they were doing at helping the rabbit escape. 
  If they had been given the <code>Grader</code> class, I believe many would have 
  done a much better job with this assignment.</p>
<p>There are always a few students who want to argue about every point, and who 
  complain because the grading (based on percentage of rabbit escapes) is slightly 
  random. For those students I offered to have <code>Grader</code> run a couple 
  of thousand games, rather than a few hundred, and use that grade (which could 
  be either higher or lower). I did <b>not</b> accede to requests to run <code>Grader</code> 
  as is several times, and take the highest result!</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Caveats and observations</font></b></p>
<p>No program is perfect. This one has a drawing glitch; it doesn't draw the board 
  initially (you have to hit <code>Reset</code>), and it doesn't redraw fully 
  after being hidden by another window and then uncovered. This is a minor problem 
  on all platforms <i>except</i> MacOS X, where it is a show-stopper. I'm reasonably 
  sure that the problem is because I used the <code>Canvas</code> class incorrectly, 
  and I plan to post a corrected version in July 2004.</p>
<p>The MVC pattern that I used would have been better implemented by the <code>Observer</code> 
  interface and <code>Observable</code> class. Someday I hope to refactor <code>RabbitHunt</code> 
  to use these--&quot;when I have time.&quot; I would be delighted if someone 
  else did this for me.</p>
<p>I used inner classes for the GUI controls (hence the class files with dollar 
  signs in their names, such as <code>Controller<b>$</b>RunButtonHandler.class</code>). 
  This has the advantage that the classes don't clutter up the BlueJ UML diagrams, 
  but the disadvantage that you may not want to tell your students about inner 
  classes. It should be easy to convert these into &quot;normal&quot; classes, 
  if that is desired.</p>
<p>I used the AWT in this program. If I were to rewrite the program today, I might 
  use Swing instead.</p>
<p>Of the above, I consider only the MacOS X problem to be critical. Since I encourage 
  students to <i>read my code,</i> I want everything to be as polished as possible. 
  Actually, though, the code for the <code>Fox</code> class contains everything 
  the students need to know, and most students won't look at the rest of the code..</p>

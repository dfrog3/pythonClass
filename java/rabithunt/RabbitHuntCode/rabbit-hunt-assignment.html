<p><b><font size="+1">The purposes of this assignment are:</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>To improve your understanding of classes, objects, and inheritance</li>
  <li>To give you more practice in reading code as well as writing code</li>
  <li>To demonstrate non-algorithmic programming</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Here's the story:</font></b></p>
<p>A <b>fox</b> is hunting a <b>rabbit</b> in a field. The field contains a number 
  of <b>bushes</b> which obstruct both the fox's view and the rabbit's view, so 
  each may or may not be able to see the other. The fox tries to catch the rabbit; 
  the rabbit tries to get away from the fox. If the fox can catch the rabbit, 
  he eats it (and wins). If the rabbit can keep away from the fox for 100 turns, 
  the rabbit wins. </p>
<p>You are the rabbit.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Getting started:</b></font></p>
<p>Download the <a href="RabbitHunt.zip">RabbitHunt.zip</a> file and unzip it. 
  It's a BlueJ package, so you should be able to run it easily; you will see something 
  like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="hunt.jpg" width="428" height="479"></p>
<p>The big red dot represents the fox, the small brown dot is the rabbit, and 
  the green blobs are bushes.</p>
<p>Run the program a few times and see what happens. Notice that you can step 
  through the hunt, or just let it run. You can adjust the speed at which the 
  animation proceeds (this does not affect what happens, only how quickly it happens). 
  Notice that the rabbit almost always meets an untimely end. However, occasionally 
  the rabbit will evade the fox for 100 turns, and the rabbit wins--this doesn't 
  happen very often.</p>
<p>Now look at the<code> Rabbit </code>class. It has a constructor<code> Rabbit(model,&nbsp;row,&nbsp;column)</code>, 
  and it has a method<code> decideMove()</code>, which decides how the rabbit 
  is going to move at each turn. The rabbit I've given you is a really stupid 
  rabbit--it just moves randomly.</p>
<p>Your job is to improve the<code> Rabbit </code>class so that the rabbit escapes 
  more often. This is your class; you can do (almost) anything you want with it. 
  You can (and should!) look at all the other classes, but the<code> Rabbit </code>class 
  is the only one you are allowed to change (unless you get my permission, which 
  you won't get unless you have a very good reason). If you find errors or problems 
  in the other classes, let me know, and I'll post an updated version for everybody.</p>
<p>It is probably impossible to find a strategy for the rabbit that ensures a 
  100% survival rate.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Structure of the program</font></b></p>
<p>This program uses the Model-View-Controller design pattern. That is, there 
  are separate classes (which I have named<code> Model</code>,<code> View</code>, 
  and<code> Controller </code>just for pedagogical purposes--they could have been 
  named anything) that do the following:</p>
<dl> 
  <dt><code><b>Model</b></code></dt>
  <dd>The <code>Model</code> represents the &quot;rules of the game.&quot; It 
    does all the computation, all the work of deciding whose turn it is, what 
    happens, and whether anyone has won. The <code>Model</code> is strictly &quot;internal&quot;--it 
    does the &quot;thinking,&quot; and has practically nothing to do with the 
    other parts of the program.</dd>
  <dt><code><b>View</b></code></dt>
  <dd>The <code>View</code> displays what is going on. It puts an image on the 
    screen so the user can see what is happening. The <code>View</code> is completely 
    passive; it does not affect the hunt in any way, it's just a news reporter 
    that gives you a (partial) picture of what is happening inside the <code>Model</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code><b>Controller</b></code></dt>
  <dd>The <code>Controller</code> is the part of the program that displays the 
    controls (the four buttons and the speed controls at the bottom of the window). 
    It knows as little as possible about the <code>Model</code> and <code>View</code>; 
    it basically tells the <code>Model</code> when to go and when to stop. It 
    does, however, display a message at the end of the game; this should probably 
    have been in the <code>View</code> class.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The &quot;Model&quot; part of this program is actually composed of <b>five</b> 
  classes: <code>Model</code> (the &quot;main&quot; model class), <code>Animal</code>, 
  <code>Rabbit</code>, <code>Fox</code>, and <code>Bush</code>. <code>Rabbit</code> 
  and <code>Fox</code> are subclasses of <code>Animal</code> (as you can see from 
  the solid arrows in the BlueJ diagram); all other classes just extend <code>Object</code>. 
  This is the part of the program that you really need to understand. I'll describe 
  these classes briefly, just to get you started; but you should examine the code 
  to find out how it all really works and fits together.</p>
<p>The <code>Controller</code> and <code>View</code> classes are almost entirely 
  independent of the <code>Model</code> class. The <code>Rabbit</code> class is 
  part of the Model. This means that you do <i>not</i> have to understand anything 
  about either the Controller or the View in order to complete your assignment. 
  (It wouldn't hurt to look at them, however, because you will be learning how 
  to do similar things later in this course.)</p>
<p>The<code> Hunt </code>class just creates<code> model</code>,<code> view</code>, 
  and<code> controller </code>objects, and turns control over to the controller 
  object.</p>
<p>The <code>Model</code> class:</p>
<ul>
  <li>places the fox, rabbit, and bushes in the field</li>
  <li>gives the rabbit and the fox each a chance to move (one moves, then the 
    other--they don't both move at the same time)</li>
  <li>tells the <code>View</code> to display the result of these two moves, and</li>
  <li>determines which animal won</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <code>Model</code> provides several constants that you can use:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.N</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;north&quot; (straight up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.NE</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;northeast&quot; (up and to the right)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.E</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;east&quot; (to the right)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.SE</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;southeast&quot; (to the right and down)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.S</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;south&quot; (straight down)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.SW</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;southwest&quot; (to the left and down)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.W</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;west&quot; (to the left)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.NW</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;northwest&quot; (up and to the left)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.STAY</code></td>
      <td>indicates &quot;no move&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#CCFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.MIN_DIRECTION</code></td>
      <td>the numerically smallest direction (not including <code>STAY</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#CCFFCC"> 
      <td><code>Model.MAX_DIRECTION</code></td>
      <td>the numerically largest direction (not including <code>STAY</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#CCFFFF"> 
      <td><code>Model.BUSH</code></td>
      <td>indicates a bush</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#CCFFFF"> 
      <td><code>Model.FOX</code></td>
      <td>indicates a fox</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#CCFFFF"> 
      <td><code>Model.RABBIT</code></td>
      <td>indicates a rabbit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#CCFFFF"> 
      <td><code>Model.EDGE</code></td>
      <td>indicates the edge of the board</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

</blockquote>
  
<p align="left">Finally, <code>Model</code> provides the following method<code>:</code></p>
<dl> 
  <dt><code>static&nbsp;int&nbsp;turn(int&nbsp;direction,&nbsp;</code><code>int&nbsp;amount)</code></dt>
  <dd>Given a starting direction and tne number of 1/8 turns to make <i>clockwise</i>, 
    this method returns the resultant direction. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Other classes that form part of the Model are:</p>
<dl> 
  <dt><code>Bush</code></dt>
  <dd>This <code></code>class doesn't do anything. The Model creates bushes and 
    places them, but the bushes themselves just sit there and get in the way.</dd>
  <dt><code>Animal</code></dt>
  <dd>This is the superclass for both the <code>Rabbit</code> class and the <code>Fox</code> 
    class. It provides methods that are the same for both the rabbit and the fox: 
    looking in a particular direction, measuring the distance to an object, and 
    moving.</dd>
  <dt><code>Fox</code></dt>
  <dd>The fox is an animal that tries to catch and eat the rabbit.</dd>
  <dt><code>Rabbit</code></dt>
  <dd>The rabbit is an animal that tries not to get caught and eaten.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <code>Animal</code> class provides the following methods. Since <code>Fox</code> 
  and <code>Rabbit</code> are subclasses of <code>Animal</code>, they <i>inherit</i> 
  these methods, and can use them just as if they had defined the methods themselves.</p>
<dl> 
  <dt><code>int look(int direction)</code></dt>
  <dd>Return one of the constants <code>Model.BUSH</code>, <code>Model.FOX</code>,<code> 
    Model.RABBIT</code>, or <code>Model.EDGE</code>, depending on what the animal 
    sees in that direction.</dd>
  <dt> <code>int distance(int direction)</code></dt>
  <dd>Returns the number of steps the animal would have to make in order to land 
    on top of the nearest object (or go off the edge of the playing area).</dd>
  <dt><code>boolean canMove(int direction)</code></dt>
  <dd>Tells whether the animal can move in the given direction without being stopped 
    by a bush or the edge of the board. Does <i>not</i> tell whether it's a good 
    idea to move in that direction.</dd>
</dl>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The part you have to write:</b></font></p>
<p>When it is the rabbit's turn to move, the model sends the message<code> decideMove() 
  </code>to the rabbit. The rabbit must return a direction in which to move. I 
  have written a<code> Rabbit </code>class, but my rabbit makes really stupid 
  moves. Your job is to fix the<code> Rabbit </code>class by replacing my<code> 
  decideMove() </code>method with a better one. </p>
<p><i>Note that the rabbit does not actually move itself.</i> Instead, it responds 
  to the<code> decideMove() </code>message by returning the direction in which 
  it wants to move. The model will then move the rabbit in that direction, if 
  the move is possible and legal. If the move cannot be made (because of a bush 
  or the edge of the board), the rabbit will not move.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The contract:</b></font></p>
<p>I'm putting the complete source code up on the web, <i>as it exists today.</i> 
  I may change it. I probably <i>will</i> change it. There are some things I don't 
  like about my code, and I expect to give you a new, improved version. How can 
  you write your assignment if my code keeps changing?</p>
<p>The answer is the <i>contract.</i> You are welcome to look at my code--in fact, 
  much of the reason for this assignment is to get you to read someone else's 
  code. I can change any part of my code in any way I like, so long as I satisfy 
  the contract.</p>
<p>So, what is this mysterious contract? The contract is <i>whatever I say about 
  the program in the javadoc comments.</i> If I say in the javadoc comments that 
  the program does something, it had better do that thing. Anything I don't say, 
  I can change. For example, if I tell you in the javadoc comments that<code> 
  Model.EDGE </code>is the integer 2, then it has to remain a 2. If I don't say, 
  I am free to change it to be the integer 37 if I want to.</p>
<p>Contracts are necessary when more than one person is working on different parts 
  of the same program. Your javadoc comments tell the world what to expect from 
  your code. You have to say enough so that your code can be used by someone else. 
  But equally important, you have to <i>not</i> say in the contract anything that 
  your users don't really need to know, because everything that you tell them, 
  you are committing to keep that way forever and ever.</p>
<p>A good craftsman knows his/her tools! Have you explored the BlueJ menus? In 
  particular, have you ever selected<code> Interface </code>from the drop-down 
  menu in an editor window? If not, now would be a good time to explore it.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Due date and grading:</b></font></p>
<p>Turn in your program via Blackboard by Friday, October 25, before midnight<b>.</b></p>
<p>Your grade will be the percentage of times that the rabbit escapes the fox. 
  You are expected to use good style, as defined by <b>Rule 1</b>.</p>
